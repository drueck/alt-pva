# alt-pva

This project is an alternative front end for [Portland Volleyball
Association](https://portlandvolleyball.org) league information, built on top
of the [pva_data](https://github.com/drueck/pva_data) GraphQL API.

It's super basic and minimal now, but I hope to use it as a playground to
experiment with front end UI and UX design and to create an interface that is
attractive, fast, and useful.
